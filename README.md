This repository contains two Arduino programs for an IoT-based robotic car: 

-One version follows a predetermined routine and autonomously avoids obstacles using a HC-SR04 sensor placed on the front.

-The other version is based on the previous one but connects to the internet and is remotely controlled via API.
